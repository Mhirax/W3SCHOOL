<!-- introducing HSL and HSLA colors -->
<!-- HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity). -->

<!-- hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white. -->

<!-- HSL color values -->
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(0, 100%, 50%);">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(240, 100%, 50%);">hsl(240, 100%, 50%)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(147, 50%, 47%);">hsl(147, 50%, 47%)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(300, 76%, 72%);">hsl(300, 76%, 72%)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(39, 100%, 50%);">hsl(39, 100%, 50%)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(248, 53%, 58%);">hsl(248, 53%, 58%)</h1>


<!-- Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.

100% is pure color, no shades of gray.

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color. -->
