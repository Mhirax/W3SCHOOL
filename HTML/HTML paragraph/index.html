<!-- The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<p>The <hr>HR tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr>hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:</p>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>


The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre>pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
